<p class="Style1" style="line-height:12px;margin-bottom:11.25px;margin-top:0px;">If you are allowed to download or use any Software in connection with the Services, Ticket Pointe hereby grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-exclusive license to use the Software solely for your internal use in connection with the Services, and only in accordance with this TOS and the written instructions/directions (if any) provided by Ticket Pointe in conjunction with the Software.

<p class="Style1" style="line-height:12px;margin-bottom:11.25px;margin-top:0px;">When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service. You agree to pay to Ticket Pointe a processing fee of 2.9% of the cost of the ticket plus and additional US$1.30. All fees paid to Ticket Pointe are non-refundable by Ticket Pointe and are subject to the refund policy of the individual promoter of each event.</p>

<p class="Style1" style="line-height:12px;margin-bottom:11.25px;margin-top:0px;">4.2 Refunds.</p>

<p class="Style1" style="line-height:12px;margin-bottom:11.25px;margin-top:0px;">Ticket Pointe will not be responsible for issuing refunds of any nature to any buyer under any circumstances.
